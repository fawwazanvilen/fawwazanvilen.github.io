# intro
A good friend asked me a few weeks ago , "What would you do if you were the governor of Jakarta?" and I went into this long rant about *land value tax*, and how I would implement them around Jakarta's very own idiosyncrasies, and how instituting a tax on land value would result in some very nice properties that we should care about when building a city, ... like I usually do.
But I also realized then that I don't really have a public-facing work that can act as something ?????
